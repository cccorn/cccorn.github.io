I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Computer and Information Science at the University of Pennsylvania, advised by Prof. [Gushu Li](https://sites.google.com/view/gushuli) and Prof. [Steve Zdancewic](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~stevez). I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Technology from the Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences, advised by Prof. [Mingsheng Ying](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/Mingsheng.Ying).

## Research interests
My research interests lie in **quantum information** and **formal methods**, particularly in learning, testing, and verification of quantum systems.
I am also interested in **computer vision** and **machine learning**.
